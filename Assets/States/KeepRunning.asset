  storyText: 'You keep running with him.

    

    "Um... What? What do you mean?"
    you ask.

    

    "I don''t know! I went and asked the guy if he was alright,
    and he tried to bite me! And now he has been shambling towards me so I am running!"

    

    You
    both see a policeman waving his arms to get your attention.

    

    What
    do you do?

    1. Go to the policeman with the guy.

    2. Stop running.
    This is nonsense.'
