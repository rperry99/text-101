  storyText: 'How strange...

    

    You start to walk to your apartment when
    you hear a groaning coming from behind a parked car.

    

    You look around
    the car, and you see a woman hunched over.

    

    What do you do?

    1.
    Touch her shoulder "Miss are you okay?"

    2. Walk around to see what the
    woman is doing.

    3. Go back inside and go back to bed.'
