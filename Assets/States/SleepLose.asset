  storyText: 'You don''t care anywhere near enough to find out what that was. You
    don''t live in a great neighborhood, so maybe it was a robbery gone bad.

    

    You
    get back in bed and fall asleep.

    

    You get woken up a few minutes
    after you pass out. Something busted your door down. There is a man on top of
    you.

    

    In your daze, you can''t get the man off. He bites you on your
    throat.

    

    You bleed out.

    

    You did not survive.'
