    don't live in a great neighborhood, so maybe it was a robbery gone bad.\r You
    get back in bed and fall asleep.\r\n\r\nYou get woken up a few minutes after
    you pass out. Something busted your door down. There is a man on top of you.\r\n\r\nIn
    your daze, you can't get the man off. He bites you on your throat.\r\n\r\nYou
