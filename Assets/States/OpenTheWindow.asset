  storyText: 'You walk up to your big picture window. You pull the side of the curtain
    just enough so you can look outside.

    

    It looks like a ghost town
    outside. There are cars parked in ways that looks like people got out and ran
    on foot.

    

    You see one person running, with another person walking
    behind him.

    

    Weird.

    

    What''s next?

    1. Go back to
    bed

    2. Head out of the apartment

    3. Call a friend.'
